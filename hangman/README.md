If playing, a random sentence from the repository is selected.
The sentence is partially revealed, showing only the first and last letters and spaces between words.
Players guess individual letters to potentially reveal their positions within the sentence.
Each incorrect guess adds a body part to the hangman figure, bringing him closer to completion.

Incorrect guesses are not penalized beyond contributing to the hangman's progress.
After winning or losing, players return to the main menu to choose their next action.
