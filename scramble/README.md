1. Overview

Scramble is a single-player word unscrambling game designed to test your vocabulary and strategic thinking. Presented with a jumbled word, your objective is to rearrange the letters within a limited number of moves, forming the correct word.

2. Gameplay

Board: The game displays a single, shuffled word on-screen.
Pieces: You don't have physical pieces. Instead, you directly manipulate the letters within the word.
Turns: Each round allows you to swap two different letters within the word.
Swapping: Select two letters and exchange their positions.
Undo: You can undo a previous swap, but this doesn't restore your move count.
Winning: Successfully unscramble the word within the allowed number of moves.
Losing: Exceed the move limit without forming the correct word.
