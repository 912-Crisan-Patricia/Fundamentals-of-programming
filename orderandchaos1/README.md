1. Overview

Order and Chaos is a two-player strategy game played on a 6x6 grid. One player takes the role of Order (X), aiming to create a line of five Xs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The other player takes the role of Chaos (O), seeking to prevent Order from achieving their goal and fill the board before any five-in-a-row is formed. Players take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols, utilizing strategic thinking and tactical maneuvering to advance their own plans while hindering their opponent's.
